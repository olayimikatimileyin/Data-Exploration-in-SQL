Project Title Donor Insights and Donation Rates Analysis for Education for ALL

Objectives Increase the number of donors in our database. Increase the donation frequency of our database. Increase the value of donations in our database. Project Code The SQL code for this project can be found here.

Analysis Overview As a Data Analyst, I was tasked with presenting insights from donation data to the Head of Fundraising. The analysis was aimed at understanding the donor base, identifying key trends, and providing actionable recommendations to boost fundraising efforts.

Key SQL Techniques Used JOIN: To combine data from multiple tables. ORDER BY: To sort the data. WHERE: To filter the data based on specific conditions. BETWEEN, AND, OR: To set specific ranges and conditions for data retrieval. SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(): To perform aggregate calculations. GROUP BY, HAVING: To group data and filter groups based on conditions.

Methodology Root Cause Analysis: Applied to understand the underlying issues affecting donor retention and donation frequency. Data Analysis and Visualization: Utilized Tableau for creating visual insights to better understand donation patterns and donor demographics.

Key Findings Donor Statistics: Total number of donors: 1000 Total donations collected: $249,085 Largest donation: $500 Smallest donation: $5

Top Donors: Top 10 donors contribute between $400 and $500 weekly.

Donation Frequency: Majority of donations are made yearly or once. Only a small percentage of donations are made weekly.

Geographic Insights: Highest donation amounts come from California, New York, and Florida. Majority of donors reside in California, Texas, and Florida.

Education and Donations: Educated donors, especially those with university education, tend to donate larger amounts. Gender is not a significant factor in donation amounts.

Recommendations Product Recommendations Focus on Weekly Donations: Develop strategies to increase the frequency of weekly donations. Target Educated Donors: Given that educated individuals are more likely to donate higher amounts, efforts should be made to engage this demographic further.

Marketing Recommendations Increase Awareness in Other States: While a large number of donors are from California, Texas, and Florida, there is potential to attract more donors from other states. University Graduates' Societies: Leverage university graduate societies and other educational networks to spread awareness and encourage donations.

Conclusion By analyzing donor and donation data, I have provided insights to help Education for ALL address the challenge of increasing funding. The recommendations focus on enhancing donor engagement, particularly among educated individuals, and improving the frequency of donations. Implementing these strategies can lead to a more robust and consistent funding stream for the organization.
